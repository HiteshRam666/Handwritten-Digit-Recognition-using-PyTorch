# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-PyTorch

## Introduction

Handwritten Digit Recognition is the process of digitizing human handwritten digit images. It is a difficult task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with a variety of flavors. In order to address this issue, we created HDR, which uses the image of a digit to identify the digit that is present in the image.

In this project, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the PyTorch framework to Recognition of Handwritten Digit.

A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign learnable weights and biases to various objects in the image and be able to distinguish one from the other.

It is used to analyze visual imagery. Object detection, face recognition, robotics, video analysis, segmentation, pattern recognition, natural language processing, spam detection, topic categorization, regression analysis, speech recognition, image classification are some of the examples that can be done using Convolutional Neural Networking.

## Conclusion 

Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) can be used to predict Handwritten Digits reasonably. We have successfully developed Handwritten digit recognition with Python, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning libraries. Handwritten Digits have been recognized by more than 98.9% validation accuracy.
